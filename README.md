# Further Improvements that can be made:
* As we know the saying, "there is always room for improvement.‚Äù Because nobody is perfect but we can work towards making things better, so we have some ideas to make our product even more robust and better.

## Back-End Server:
* As of now, we are using browser local storage and json-server API to store and retrieve data to our app. But in the future when we will get familiar with Nodejs in our curriculum we can implement a MySQL or a NoSQL database to store the application data.

## Dynamic Recipe Recommendation:
* Till now we have worked only with the food nutrition data but if we want, we can also dynamically recommend recipes to the user based on the food items selected by the user.
